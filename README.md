# High-Dimensional Fuzzy Inference Systems (HDFISs)

This code is a Python implementation of the paper "High-Dimensional Fuzzy Inference Systems"

The paper proposes two fuzzy systems for solving high-dimensional problems, which are HDFIS-prod and HDFIS-min.
They are based on product and minimum T-norms.

The code requires:
* python (>= 3.8)
* torch (>= 1.9.0)
* scikit-learn (>= 1.0.2)
